# Dataset-sanity-checks-for-Classification-

## Product overview

The solution explores the raw input dataset and identifies various data discrepancies like Data duplicates, Label ambiguity, Variable mix, Variable prediction contribution and Label drift. The solution tests for these discrepancies and report the user of its suitability for Classification Modeling. It output the quantified measure of the discrepancies and alert the user of necessary data preparation required prior to training.


## Product Highlights

* Data sanity refers to the correctness of the data showing absence of discrepancies such as duplicates, Label ambiguity, drift, etc and its conformance to Machine learning requirements. This solution checks the input dataset for discrepancies like Data Duplicates, Label Ambiguity, Label drift, Variable mix, Variable prediction contribution (with Population Stability Index Score) and gives an early warning to the user to perform data preparation before model training. The early identification of the data discrepancies avoids percolation of error to classification models and prediction

* The solution accepts tabular dataset containing at least one valid Label variable to be used in Classification modeling. The acceptable data types for variables include Numerical, Categorical and Strings. The solution gives the proportion of integer and strings mix within train test splits of the given dataset. The correctness of the dataset can be reported for various Label assignments (if more than one Label exist). The solution expects the user to define explicitly for Label, Index and Categorical variables in a dataset for every run.

* PACE - ML is Mphasis Framework and Methodology for end-to-end machine learning development and deployment. PACE-ML enables organizations to improve the quality & reliability of the machine learning solutions in production and helps automate, scale, and monitor them.
